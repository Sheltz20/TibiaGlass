- Build a Windows WPF app (C#/.NET 8).
- Keep the app lightweight and avoid unnecessary dependencies.
- Prefer simple, robust Win32 interop (keyboard hook) over complex frameworks.
- The app should run from a tray icon and not show a main window by default.
- Hotkey behavior: show magnifier while Alt is held; hide immediately on release.
